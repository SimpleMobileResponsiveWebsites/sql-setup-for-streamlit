To view and work with the SQLite database file (database.db) in PyCharm, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the SQLite Plugin (Optional)
If you donâ€™t have a database tool integrated into PyCharm, you can install the Database Tools and SQL plugin:

Go to File > Settings > Plugins.
Search for Database Tools and SQL and install it.
Restart PyCharm if necessary.
2. Open the Database Tool Window
In PyCharm, go to View > Tool Windows > Database.
The Database window should now appear in the sidebar.
3. Connect to the SQLite Database
Click the "+" icon in the Database tool window and select Data Source > SQLite.
In the Data Source Properties dialog:
Set File to the path where your database.db is located (e.g., /path/to/database.db).
Click OK.
4. View Tables and Data
Once connected, you will see the list of tables in the Database tool window.
Right-click on a table and select "Jump to Data" to view its contents.
Alternative Approach: Using SQLite Browser
If you prefer a simpler tool or don't have the plugin:

Download DB Browser for SQLite (SQLiteBrowser).
Open the database.db file with this tool to view, edit, and run queries.
This setup should let you view and work with your SQLite database directly in PyCharm!
